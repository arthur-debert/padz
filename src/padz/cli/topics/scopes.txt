Projects and Global Notes

Padz stores notes in two scopes: Project (local to a repo) or Global (user-wide).

THE TWO SCOPES
--------------

Project Scope (default):
  Data stored in: <repo_root>/.padz/
  Use case: Project-specific notes, TODOs, code snippets

Global Scope (-g flag):
  Data stored in: OS data directory
    - macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/com.padz.padz/
    - Linux:   ~/.local/share/padz/
    - Windows: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\padz\padz\
  Use case: Cross-project notes, personal reminders, grocery lists


HOW PADZ FINDS YOUR PROJECT
---------------------------

When you run padz (without -g), it searches for your project root:

1. Start at your current directory
2. Look for a directory with BOTH .git AND .padz
3. If found: use that as project root
4. If not found: check parent directory
5. Stop at home directory or filesystem root

Why require BOTH .git AND .padz?
  - .git alone isn't enough: avoids accidentally using parent repos in monorepos
  - .padz alone isn't enough: maintains semantic binding to "project" concept

This means you must run `padz init` in a repo to opt-in to project scope.


NESTED REPOSITORIES
-------------------

In monorepos or nested git structures:

  parent-repo/        (.git + .padz)
    child-repo/       (.git only)
      your-code/

Running padz from child-repo/ will use parent-repo/.padz/ (walks up until
it finds both .git and .padz together).

To give child-repo its own notes: run `padz init` inside child-repo.


USING THE GLOBAL FLAG
---------------------

Add -g to any command to use global scope:

  padz -g list          # List global notes
  padz -g create        # Create global note
  padz -g view 1        # View global note #1

The -g flag must come BEFORE the subcommand.


SWITCHING BETWEEN SCOPES
------------------------

Project and global notes are completely separate. Use -g to access global
notes from any directory. Without -g, you're always in project scope.

Example workflow:
  cd ~/projects/myapp
  padz create "Fix auth bug"      # Saved to myapp/.padz/
  padz -g create "Buy groceries"  # Saved to global data dir
  padz list                       # Shows only myapp notes
  padz -g list                    # Shows only global notes


INITIALIZING PROJECT SCOPE
--------------------------

To enable project-scope notes in a git repository:

  cd /path/to/your/repo
  padz init

This creates the .padz/ directory. You may want to add .padz/ to your
.gitignore if you don't want to share notes with collaborators.
