PADZ Live Test Shell
====================
You're in an isolated workspace with two scopes:

  Global scope:  Stay here (workspace root, no git)
  Project scope: Run 'proj' to cd into projects/project-a/

Commands:
  padz, pa     Run the dev binary
  proj         cd to project-a (project scope)
  ws           cd to workspace root (global scope)
  scope        Show current scope
  env_info     Show environment details

Exit the shell to clean up.
